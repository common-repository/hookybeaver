== Description ==

HookyBeaver is a text editing solution for adding content to the majority of all Beaver Builder Action Hooks. This is a third party product and not created or supported by our friends at <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" target="_blank">Beaver Builder</a>

1. Use the image to find the location of the hook in which you would like to enter some text.
2. Enter your text in the text editor section
3. Save your changes.
4. Check your work on the public facing side of the site.

Stylesheet is included for the basic layout of the plugin.
All hook divs have their own class so you can update the CSS however you need to.

Use your browser's inspector to locate the classes for the specific div in which that hook is contained and add your own styling to the content.
